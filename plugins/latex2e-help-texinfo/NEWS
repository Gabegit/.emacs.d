A bit more about figures and indexes, use of @table where appropriate in

Changes in release 2.0:

After discussions with Torsten and Stephen Gilmore, maintainership of
this document has been handed off to me.  See the README for more
project info.

Dozens of missing commands added; all mathematical symbol commands in
basic LaTeX are now included.  Also a few usage examples, template
documents, default values, and more.  Of course plenty more work could
be done, contributions welcome.

The Info file is now named latex2e.info, for consistency.  ltx-help.el
updated accordingly.

Derived files generated with the current TeX and Texinfo.

Changes in release 1.6:

Some minor bug fixes; thanks to Piet van Oostrum and Ralf
Fassel for those.

The node previously named 'List of Commands' is now named 'Command
Index' so that the Emacs command Info-index may work. Suggested by Ralf
Fassel.  'ltx-help.el' has therefore been updated. You _must_ use the
ltx-help.el included in this release with version 1.6 of latex2e.texi.
A bug has also been fixed in ltx-help.el; thanks to Kurt Hornik for
this.

As always, bug reports and comments are welcome.
