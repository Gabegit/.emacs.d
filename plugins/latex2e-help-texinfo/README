README for latex2e.texi, aka the latex2e-help-texinfo package.
Public domain.  This file originally written 2008, Karl Berry.

This project is an attempt to write a reference manual for core LaTeX.
It is unofficial and the LaTeX Project members have not reviewed it.

http://home.gna.org/latexrefman (the project home page) has more
information, including links to the current output in various formats,
sources, mailing lists, and other infrastructure.

Help is most definitely wanted.  (Search for "xx" in the source for only
a few of the known deficiencies.)  Please email any bug reports, new
material, general discussion, whatever, to latexrefman-discuss@gna.org.
