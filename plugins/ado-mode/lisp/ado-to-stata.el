;;; a collection of things for interacting with Stata 
;;; Currently this works in Mac OS X and MS Windows. It will not cause errors in 
;;;   other OSes. All that is needed for each other OS are some methods
;;;   for talking to Stata from emacs. 
;;;   In Mac OS X, this is done via the applescript send2stata.scpt
;;;   In MS Windows, this is done via the autoit executable send2stata.exe
