;; Description:
;;
;; This file contains all of the customizable things for ado
;; mode.  If you are using Emacs 20, or an earlier version of Emacs
;; which has the customization package installed, you can change all
;; of the relevant variables here via customization.  This is
;; preferable to doing it "by hand" in your .emacs file.
;; .... unless you really really like tinkering with .emacs files.
